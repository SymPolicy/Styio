# Audit Specs

**Purpose:** Define the code-audit checklist and design-principle baseline every human reviewer and agent must apply before accepting implementation work.

## Scope

This directory owns audit rules that apply across code, tests, docs, gates, and handoff contracts.

Start with [CODE-AUDIT-CHECKLIST.md](./CODE-AUDIT-CHECKLIST.md). Its first required check is whether the code follows the seven design principles.

The audit gate is repository-internal: `scripts/local-info-leak-gate.py` runs through the `styio-audit` CI job and the local delivery gate. This repository does not expose an external audit interface.

Generated inventory: [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md).
